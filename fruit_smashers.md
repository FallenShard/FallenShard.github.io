        Fruit Smashers is a multiplayer arcade racing game developed for the Game Programming Lab course taken at ETH during
        my Master studies. The theme for the developed games that year was "Food". The project was realized in a team of four.

        The gameplay is round-based, where the goal is to either hit or defend the fruit stands to score points.
        Two teams of up to two players or AI bots can play with multiplayer split-screen.

        My software development activities included:
        <ul>
            <li>architectural design and coding of core elements (main loop, game state management)</li>
            <li>GUI</li>
            <li>input handling system</li>
            <li>animations</li>
            <li>various gameplay elements</li>
        </ul>
        The rest of the team was devoted mostly to graphics, physics and AI.
