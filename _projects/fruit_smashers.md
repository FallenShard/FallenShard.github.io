For my Master Thesis, I was working on the problem of real-time fluid rendering and style transfer.
The goal was to improve the rendering methods for a machine-learning based physics simulation technology that was developed
by my supervisors. The developed methods allow rendering of water, foam, granular materials and smoke.

In the end, the resulting paper was sent to SIGGRAPH 2017 Real-time Live! and its submission can be seen
in the video above.

In addition to that, I've experimented with real-time style transfer methods that could be used for
procedural texturing, stylistic level design and ethereal sequences in video games. At the time of development,
real-time style transfer was not yet an explored topic, and we have barely succeeded using latest generation GPUs
in conjunction with fast stylization using neural networks.

Some of the produced stylized captures are featured in the videos below.

            Fruit Smashers is a multiplayer arcade racing game developed for the Game Programming Lab course taken at ETH during
            my Master studies. The theme for the developed games that year was "Food". The project was realized in a team of four.

            The gameplay is round-based, where the goal is to either hit or defend the fruit stands to score points.
            Two teams of up to two players or AI bots can play with multiplayer split-screen.

            My software development activities included:
            <ul>
                <li>architectural design and coding of core elements (main loop, game state management)</li>
                <li>GUI</li>
                <li>input handling system</li>
                <li>animations</li>
                <li>various gameplay elements</li>
            </ul>
            The rest of the team was devoted mostly to graphics, physics and AI.
