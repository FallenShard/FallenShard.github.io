This solo project was created for the course "Human Computer Interaction" during my
Bachelor's at Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Nis.

The main idea was the showcase UI design patterns commonly found in MMORPGs, as
well as the flexibilty and rapid prototyping entirely in Qt and QML.

The UI direction is reminiscent of MMOs popular in the beginning of 2010s, like
World of Warcraft.
