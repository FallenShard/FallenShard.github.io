        Target-driven Fire Simulation was created for the "Physically-based Simulation" AS15 course at ETH Zurich. The project was realized in a team of three.

    <p>
        The simulation framework supports specification of shapes which drive external forces that influence the smoke and fire simulation, causing it to appear and animate in the shapes' silhouettes.

        My development activities included:
        <ul>
            <li>software architectural design</li>
            <li>contributions to core simulation code</li>
            <li>preview volume renderer for debugging</li>
        </ul>
        The rest of the team was devoted to implementing final rendering and parts of the simulation.
