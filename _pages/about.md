Hi there! I'm a software engineer with an interest in real-time rendering and adjacent fields. I'm currently working at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) where I am focusing on efficient photorealistic rendering methods via 3D reconstruction for mobile devices.

I am the lead developer of our cross-platform, in-house 3D Gaussian splatting engine that powers both scenes (Hyperscapes) and Codec Avatars, written in Vulkan.

If you have a Quest device, you can try our [Hyperscape Horizon Demo](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-demo/7972066712871980/?srsltid=AfmBOopIAXN1Xg6-BT16z1MCYNFZbpEps4lRgg9O9JJ8r8jYHiw49M0g) to see some of reconstructed environments in VR!
